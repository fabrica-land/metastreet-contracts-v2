/**
 * ENG-3231: borrow() takes a required designated `borrower` parameter (breaking
 * change vs upstream MetaStreet). The designated borrower becomes the
 * borrower-of-record / beneficial owner of the (encumbered) collateral, while
 * collateral is pulled from msg.sender (the caller/router) and principal is
 * sent to msg.sender. This is the financed-buy primitive: a router funds the
 * purchase and takes the proceeds; the designated party ends up owning the
 * collateral and owing the loan. No authorization is enforced (Tim's lean: the
 * obligation receipt is freely transferable, like accepting an ERC-721).
 *
 * Non-fork. TestLiquidatablePool with a trivial interest model (repayment ==
 * principal, adminFee == 0) so the designated-borrower routing is the focus,
 * not the pricing math.
