/**
 * Branch coverage for the ENG-3076 edits to `Pool.repay`'s currency-token
 * pull. The happy path (transferFrom returns true) is exercised by every
 * test in `FabricaLendingPoolRepay.t.sol`. The two non-happy branches of the
 * `require(currencyToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), unscaledRepayment))`
 * statement are exercised here:
 *
 *   E. transferFrom returns false  → require reverts (no implicit panic)
 *   F. transferFrom returns nothing → strict ABI decoder reverts
 *
 * Both branches must leave loan state unchanged so that the borrower's
 * collateral remains escrowed and the loan can still be repaid by an
 * ERC-20-compliant caller.
