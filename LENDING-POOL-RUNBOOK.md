# Fabrica Lending Pool Upgrade Runbook

The beacon-based upgrade runbook for the Fabrica lending pool stack in
`contracts/`. (FabricaToken and the other Fabrica-owned contracts have their
own UUPS upgrade runbook in the `fabrica-land/fabrica-v3-contracts` repo.)

`networks/sepolia.json` in the fabrica-land/fabrica-v3-subgraph repo.
No broadcast logs existed in this repo prior to ENG-3076; the stack
was deployed by an earlier process. Running future
`FabricaLendingPoolStackDeploy.s.sol` / `FabricaLendingPoolUpgrade.s.sol`
under `--broadcast` will write logs to `broadcast/`.)

> broadcast records the ORIGINAL stack deploy — its BorrowLogic/DepositLogic
> addresses predate the ENG-3231 library relink. The current, live post-ENG-3231

### Mainnet

No Fabrica-forked deployment yet. Production lending uses the upstream
MetaStreet pool at `0x842Ffbf1AD5314503904626122376f71603A3Cf9`
(`MetaStreetPoolAllTokens`, IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION 2.15, owned by
MetaStreet — not upgradable by Fabrica). Fabrica's own stack will be
deployed via `FabricaLendingPoolStackDeploy.s.sol` once the Sepolia
upgrade path is validated.

## Upgrade Pattern

Pools are deployed by `PoolFactory.createProxied(beacon, params)`, which
mints a `BeaconProxy` that delegate-calls through the beacon. Upgrading
the beacon's implementation atomically upgrades every pool created
against it. There is no per-pool upgrade; you upgrade the beacon and
every BeaconProxy sees the new code on its next call.

The upgrade is a single script (`FabricaLendingPoolUpgrade.s.sol`) that
deploys the new implementation AND calls `beacon.upgradeTo(newImpl)` in
one broadcast. Both operations are run by the beacon owner, so the
split-by-wallet pattern used for FabricaToken doesn't apply here. The
script uses `vm.deployCode` (reads the precompiled artifact) rather
than direct Solidity `new WeightedRateERC1155CollectionPool(...)` to
keep its compilation graph isolated from `FabricaLendingPoolStackDeploy.s.sol`'s
— adding a second `new` site to the project would otherwise push the
pool's runtime bytecode over EIP-170.

## Running the Upgrade

### 1. Pre-flight

```bash
# Confirm the deployer wallet still owns the beacon and that the factory
# owner agrees. If these differ from what's in this table, STOP — the
# upgrade lever is no longer in the deployer's hands.
cast call 0xe1b74cbf78a693E6289dC1c983D8bC2e5097139E 'owner()(address)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
cast call 0x110bD40421Bf418A8B0d8AbA6568fB020c42Ee83 'owner()(address)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL

# Confirm the immutable args we'll bake into the new impl match the
# existing impl's. Any drift = the new impl will read wrong dependency
# addresses post-upgrade.
cast call 0x6C56d0953377D7AB479BBA85Da8d61050F774c0B 'collateralLiquidator()(address)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
cast call 0x6C56d0953377D7AB479BBA85Da8d61050F774c0B 'delegationRegistry()(address)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
cast call 0x6C56d0953377D7AB479BBA85Da8d61050F774c0B 'delegationRegistryV2()(address)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
cast call 0x6C56d0953377D7AB479BBA85Da8d61050F774c0B 'getERC20DepositTokenImplementation()(address)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
cast call 0x6C56d0953377D7AB479BBA85Da8d61050F774c0B 'collateralWrappers()(address[])' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
# liquidationGracePeriod is a constructor immutable (Fabrica ENG-3113). The
# upgrade script re-supplies it via FABRICA_LENDING_LIQUIDATION_GRACE_PERIOD
# (default 1728000 = 20 days); if you forget to export it, the upgrade silently
# rebakes the grace window. Confirm the intended value against the live impl.
cast call 0x6C56d0953377D7AB479BBA85Da8d61050F774c0B 'liquidationGracePeriod()(uint64)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### 2. Run the upgrade

```bash
# .env (e.g. fabrica-v3/fabrica-v3-contracts/.env) should include
# TESTNET_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY (the beacon owner), SEPOLIA_RPC_URL,
# and ETHERSCAN_API_KEY (for --verify).

export FABRICA_LENDING_BEACON=0xe1b74cbf78a693E6289dC1c983D8bC2e5097139E
export FABRICA_LENDING_COLLATERAL_LIQUIDATOR=0xc780FEe561fc6E50493C496a53c62518971ba9EF
export FABRICA_LENDING_DELEGATE_REGISTRY_V1=0x00000000000076A84feF008CDAbe6409d2FE638B
export FABRICA_LENDING_DELEGATE_REGISTRY_V2=0x00000000000000447e69651d841bD8D104Bed493
export FABRICA_LENDING_ERC20_DEPOSIT_TOKEN_IMPL=0x479c18dcEB406C88a0E05c86b9Ca02B6B043507B
export FABRICA_LENDING_ERC1155_COLLATERAL_WRAPPER=0xf6E3932F8b4ef957f3E361CECBF1489Ea93cb086

forge script script/FabricaLendingPoolUpgrade.s.sol:FabricaLendingPoolUpgradeScript \
  --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $TESTNET_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast \
  --verify
```

Record the printed `New WeightedRateERC1155CollectionPool:` address.
The script asserts `currentImpl != newImpl` (no-op upgrade fails fast)
and asserts `beacon.implementation() == newImpl` after the call.

### 3. Post-upgrade verification

```bash
# Beacon points at the new impl
cast call 0xe1b74cbf78a693E6289dC1c983D8bC2e5097139E 'implementation()(address)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL

# Pool BeaconProxy now sees the new IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION (set by the
# new impl's IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION constant — bump this in the next
# vendored-tree commit if you want it visible)
cast call 0x6C56d0953377D7AB479BBA85Da8d61050F774c0B 'IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION()(string)' --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL

# Functional check (ENG-3076): anyone can repay.
#   1. Borrow against a FabricaToken to mint a loan receipt.
#   2. Have a non-borrower address (with USDC + allowance) call repay() with that receipt.
#   3. Verify msg.sender's USDC was pulled and the borrower received their collateral.
# See FabricaLendingPoolRepaySepoliaFork.t.sol for the exact assertion shape.
```

## Upgrade History

| Date | Network | Impl Address | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| (initial deploy, pre-broadcast-log) | Sepolia | `0x890625c28d221B65e97D300d2BC0F305D12acDCf` | Upstream MetaStreet `WeightedRateERC1155CollectionPool` 2.15. No Fabrica modifications. |
| 2026-05-27 (ENG-3076) | Sepolia | `0xA84C15ecA620C5E4766fE0c6dd8Eaf419A838518` | Adds `Pool.depositFor(recipient, ...)` (ENG-3101) and anyone-can-repay (ENG-3076). EIP-170: 24,259 bytes (317 under). Deployed via the original FabricaLendingPoolStackDeploy.s.sol's `new WeightedRateERC1155CollectionPool(...)` site (broadcast tx `0x38efda31d7f12fe780d9a31e5b7bec0c74d15040829868de4265bbb38820bbc5`); beacon repointed via `UpgradeableBeacon.upgradeTo` shortly after. Subsequent upgrades use `FabricaLendingPoolUpgrade.s.sol` (one-shot deploy + repoint). [Etherscan-verified](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xA84C15ecA620C5E4766fE0c6dd8Eaf419A838518#code). |
| 2026-06-11 (ENG-3231) | Sepolia | `0x78F794373E7B4b2fCF86987C70abdA0e12fE9BB5` | Breaking 8-arg `borrow(address borrower, ...)` — designates the borrower-of-record/beneficial owner (repay redemption, liquidation surplus, refinance control all key off `loanReceipt.borrower`); collateral still pulled from `msg.sender`, principal still sent to `msg.sender`. The LP-dispatch layer was reclaimed from the Pool concrete into the `BorrowLogic`/`DepositLogic` external libraries to fit EIP-170: **23,628 bytes (948 under)**. New libs deployed (the `[profile.sepolia].libraries` pins above point at these): BorrowLogic `0x97bD28cd2EC4D226969221574f7EeBE301bf7557` (create tx `0xad6f6577db380f2baf5fea12bc8b85f69fb11378e18af705e58b9a86c903d104`), DepositLogic `0xcab821709338df0f718491d0f3038fbD6a16CfbE` (create tx `0xc05a58f5406f90eeaf6cc7c42e6fadb423b5d4fb70b52655ac4a7b6b103c9c59`); LiquidityLogic + ERC20DepositTokenFactory unchanged. Impl deployed + beacon repointed via `FabricaLendingPoolUpgrade.s.sol` (impl create tx `0x91c043b3312b83968b2f082f4a55334a287c32ccfddfe091ff5a0bd18ca5fe52`); beacon `0xe1b74cbf78a693E6289dC1c983D8bC2e5097139E` repointed from prior impl `0x09b91D006ecAC914e84e34C82f8266118Aaee8ED` via `UpgradeableBeacon.upgradeTo` (tx `0x3c59e896ea6d9e6984c241ed58759144b9c569acd0cf5b1b51b7255e21d7cbef`). Soil ships the lockstep `supportsBorrowerParam` per-pool flag (soil #1100). |

### Live verification (Sepolia, 2026-05-27)

Functional smoke against the LIVE upgraded pool — third-party repay
exercised the new code path end-to-end with no config change to Soil
or the API (pool address `0x6C56d0953377D7AB479BBA85Da8d61050F774c0B`
is the unchanged BeaconProxy).
